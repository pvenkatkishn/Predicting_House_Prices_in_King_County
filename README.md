<h1>üè†Predicting House Prices in King County</h1>

Welcome to the Predicting House Prices in King County repository! This project showcases a comprehensive data science workflow for predicting house prices using real-world data from King County, Washington.

<h3>üìä Project Overview:</h3> 

Housing prices are influenced by a myriad of factors, from square footage to location. This notebook dives deep into analyzing and predicting house prices using **machine learning techniques.** It's a perfect demonstration of how to combine exploratory **data analysis, feature engineering,** and **predictive modeling into a cohesive pipeline**.

<h3>üéØObjectives:</h3>

* Understand key factors driving housing prices.
* Build predictive models to estimate house prices accurately.
* Provide insights for real estate investors, homeowners, and industry professionals.

<h3>üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies</h3>

  * Programming: Python
  * Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
  * Environment: Jupyter Notebook

<h3>Result</h3>
In the test dataset, 70% of the predictions for home prices can be explained by my model.The model predicts the home prices in King Couty with an error of +-1.3% of the actual prices.As I focussed only on the physical features of the house,I can conclude that house prices are not only based on the physical properties of a house but also on several other factors.

<h3>Future Enhancements</h3>

  * Add more advanced models like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
  * Incorporate external data (e.g., interest rates, economic indicators).
  * Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
